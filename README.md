- I have two years of experience in web development and have been creating full-stack web applications using modern HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.

- I've managed a project at a hackathon, and I work well with others. In addition to developing websites, I also design visuals and UI/UX.

- I have a creative mind and a passion for developing user-friendly websites. In addition, I actively search out new technologies, enjoy reading and writing blog posts, and keep up with business trends and breakthroughs.
